##### Introduction

Welcome to the Deep Learning for Digit Classification, This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of deep learning in the context of digit classification. Digit classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and it serves as a building block for many real-world applications, including optical character recognition (OCR) and digit-based data analysis.

##### About Digit Classification

Digit classification involves the task of recognizing and categorizing handwritten or printed digits into their respective numerical representations (0-9). This seemingly simple task presents unique challenges in computer vision, as digits can vary widely in writing styles, sizes, and orientations.
